/* Reactjs is a javascript library for Building UI componenets. It is  developed by facebook

We can use the Components again and again
with some modifications in it

React community is very- very large


**Difference between Framework and Library

The Framework decides how the code should be called, it would define the structure of your project(Like where the js has to be kept, what should be the folder names etc)

Framework has MVC (Model-View-Controller) and builtin functions


while if you are using library, you can structure your project any way you want and just use the library to get your stuff done

It has only V (View) we can only create UI





 ***********JSX*****************
 JSX stands for JavaScript XML.It is a syntax extension to JavaScript .JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React


*************npx vs npm***********
they are the tools
npm - node package manager will install the package and then executes it.
// we can find that package globally

npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app



*npx(node package runner) directly executes and then uninstall that package
If we want to use the package without installing it on computer we can use npx
// we cant find that package globally

npx create-react-app ./ 
REACT APP Will be created in existing folder

OR
npx create-react-app my-app
It will create my-app folder in the parent folder 

then npm start
